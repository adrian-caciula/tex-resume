  \begin{list2}
  \item Recent projects are confidential. Here's an older six-month project (adding an ARM front-end to our x86):
    \begin{list3}
    \item Helped reverse engineer the ARMv7 ISA (this was pre-AArch64)
    \item Created architectural simulator and got Android running on it\hfill \emph{C}
